## üöÄ Use Cases & Ideas

Because this bot connects directly to n8n, the possibilities are endless. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

#### 1. AI-Powered Customer Support Agent
-   **Trigger:** A customer sends a message to your support number.
-   **N8N Workflow:**
    1.  The bot forwards the message to n8n.
    2.  n8n sends the query to an **AI model** (like OpenAI's GPT-4o or Google's Gemini).
    3.  The AI can be given context from a **Vector Database** (like Supabase or Pinecone) to answer questions based on your company's documents.
    4.  The final response is sent back to the bot, which replies to the customer.

#### 2. Real-Time Order Notifications
-   **Trigger:** A new order is placed on your Shopify, WooCommerce, or custom e-commerce store.
-   **N8N Workflow:**
    1.  The e-commerce platform triggers an n8n webhook.
    2.  n8n formats a beautiful message: "Hi [Customer Name], your order #[Order Number] has been confirmed! We'll let you know when it ships."
    3.  n8n uses the bot's API (or another method) to send this message to the customer's WhatsApp number.

#### 3. Personal Information Hub
-   **Trigger:** You send a message like "What's on my calendar today?"
-   **N8N Workflow:**
    1.  The bot forwards your message to n8n.
    2.  n8n connects to your **Google Calendar** API.
    3.  It fetches today's events, formats them into a clean list, and sends the summary back to you on WhatsApp.

#### 4. Lead Capture & CRM Integration
-   **Trigger:** A potential client messages you with an inquiry.
-   **N8N Workflow:**
    1.  The bot forwards the message to n8n.
    2.  n8n creates a new contact in your **CRM** (like HubSpot, Salesforce, or Airtable).
    3.  It sends an automated, personalized reply: "Thanks for reaching out! Someone from our team will be with you shortly."

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your own bot running in minutes.

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
-   A server or computer to run the bot 24/7 (A cheap VPS from DigitalOcean, Vultr, or Hostinger is perfect)
-   A dedicated WhatsApp account for the bot.

### üìù Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, get the code onto your machine or server.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ObisDevs/WhAIchat_n8nagent.git
cd your-repository-name
```

---

### üöÄ Step 2: Install Dependencies (Manual Setup)

Here‚Äôs how to set up the environment manually, exactly as done in the terminal. Errors and warnings are included where relevant for transparency.

```bash
# Check Node and NPM versions
node -v
npm -v
# v22.14.0
# 10.9.2

# Navigate to Desktop and create project folder
cd Desktop
mkdir my-venom-bot
cd my-venom-bot

# Initialize the project
npm init -y

# Install Venom Bot
npm install venom-bot

# Warnings during installation:
# npm WARN deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory...
# npm WARN deprecated read-package-json@6.0.4...
# ...
# 8 vulnerabilities (2 moderate, 6 high)

# Install Axios
npm install axios
# Still 8 vulnerabilities remain

# Install Dotenv
npm install dotenv

# Create project files
touch bot.js

# npm WARN deprecated sharp@<0.32.6...
# 8 high severity vulnerabilities remain
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Configure Your Bot

This is the most important step ‚Äî you need to tell the bot where to send messages.

1. Rename the example environment file:

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

2. Open the `.env` file with your preferred editor:

```bash
nano .env
```

3. Update the environment variables:

```ini
# The full webhook URL from your n8n workflow's trigger node
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL="https://your-n8n-instance.com/webhook/your-path"

# A unique name for the session file that will be created
BOT_SESSION_NAME="my-whatsapp-bot"
```

---

### üîó Step 4: Run the Bot for the First Time

You need to link your WhatsApp account by scanning a QR code.

Run the bot:

```bash
node bot.js
```

A QR code will appear in the terminal. Open WhatsApp on your phone and go to:
**Settings > Linked Devices > Link a Device**, then scan the QR code.

Once scanned, the bot will be connected!

Stop the bot anytime with:

```bash
Ctrl + C
```

---

### üßê Step 5: Run in Production (24/7)

To keep the bot running even after closing the terminal, use **PM2** (a process manager for Node.js).

1. Install PM2 globally:

```bash
npm install pm2 -g
```

2. Start your bot with PM2:

```bash
pm2 start bot.js --name my-whatsapp-bot
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Useful PM2 Commands

* **Check bot status:**

  ```bash
  pm2 status
  ```

* **View bot logs:**

  ```bash
  pm2 logs my-whatsapp-bot
  ```

* **Restart the bot:**

  ```bash
  pm2 restart my-whatsapp-bot
  ```

* **Stop the bot:**

  ```bash
  pm2 stop my-whatsapp-bot
